# Dijkstra Path Planning in a 2D Maze
---
This project implements path planning in a 2D maze using Dijkstra's algorithm and generates an animation of the shortest path search and progress. The animation is saved in AVI format.

## Features
1. **Maze Generation**: Creates a maze with walls using the `mapMaze` function.
2. **Heat Map Creation**: Generates a heat map of the maze with values based on the distance from walls.
3. **Path Planning**: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from the start node to the goal node.
4. **Animation**: Animates the search progress and saves the animation in AVI format.
---
## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020b or later recommended)
- `mapMaze` function (provided in MATLAB's Robotics Toolbox)

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the file in MATLAB.
3. Run the script. The animation will be saved as `PathPlanningAnimation.avi` in the current working directory.
